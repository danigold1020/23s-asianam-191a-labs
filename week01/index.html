                    <h2>Interests</h2>
                         <p>I am a fourth-year Statistics major at UCLA. My goal as a critical digital map maker is to shine a light on social and environmental issues and expand accessibility to technology that can help different communities raise awareness about the challenges they face as well as learn about the challenges of others so that we can come closer to finding solutions. I very much enjoy creating maps and learning how to use GIS tools, so I'm excited to strengthen my GIS skills during my journey in this class. </p>
